# SCLA Website Organization/Design

## Overview

Overall, the site is good thematically. I think that it would look a lot nicer if it were just organized better (or if we used a different host altogether). When I recommend moving widgets or text, I'll include exactly where the information is coming from and where I'd prefer it go instead.

## Notes

Because I can't use any custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, I've been experimenting with other options and looking into the [MemberClicks Support](https://help.memberclicks.com/hc/en-us/sections/14749834181645-Article-and-Page-Editing) page and found that we can still use [Slider images](https://help.memberclicks.com/hc/en-us/articles/15442887132941-Slider-Images) on the site. However, when I follow the guide on creating slider images, the preview doesn't show if it's working or not, it just shows all of the images. So I'm not sure I can tell if the slider images will work until it's published to the site; it's a shame MemberClicks won't allow us to make changes to the site to see how it looks and works without publishing it.

## My Recommendations

*Outside of finding new membership solution software...*

### Pie-in-the-sky

**Reorganize the entire site by moving widgets, articles, etc. to different tabs in the menu bar.** My recommendations would look something like this:
