<h1 dir="ltr"><span>Joint Statement Against Censorship and Amendment 32 Bill 5150</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The South Carolina Library Association (SCLA), the South Carolina Association of Public Library
		Administrators (SCAPLA), and the South Carolina Association of School Librarians (SCASL) jointly express our
		strong belief in the First Amendment rights of all South Carolinians to exercise their freedom to read and have
		unfettered access to information in public, academic, and school libraries.  We condemn any form of censorship
		and are concerned about recent attempts to censor materials in our state and across the country.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Librarians are degreed, experienced, and trained professionals who work diligently according to
		thoroughly vetted selection policies to build collections that address the needs of every library user.
		Addressing the needs of every user means acknowledging that every user is different. Each patron has the right
		to make their own reading choices, and each parent has the right to guide their own children's use of the
		library without infringing on the rights of others. Labeling material as “</span><a
		href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess124_2021-2022/sj22/20220426.htm#p10"><span>prurient</span></a><span>”
		through legislation such as </span><a
		href="https://www.scstatehouse.gov/amendments.php?KEY=30946"><span>Amendment No. 32</span></a><span> in Bill
		5150, Part 1b, Section 27, endangers patrons and library workers alike by opening them to harassment and threats
		based on subjective standards. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Supreme Court has affirmed this position in Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205
		(1975): “Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be
		suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.
		In most circumstances, the values protected by the First Amendment are no less applicable when government seeks
		to control the flow of information to minors.” See also Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist., 393 U.S.503 (1969);
		West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943); AAMA v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir.
		2001).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Again, we are strong believers in the First Amendment, and the freedom to receive information is the
		epitome of freedom of speech. South Carolina libraries have the democratic responsibility to ensure that this
		right is met. </span></p>

<h1 dir="ltr">SCLA Statement on Censorship</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The South Carolina Library Association stands behind the South Carolina Association of School
		Libraries. We support and adopt their </span><a
		href="https://www.scasl.net/assets/slideshow-images/SCASL%20position%20on%20censorship.pdf"><span>statement on
			censorship, the Freedom to Read, and support of School Libraries</span></a><span>. We support school
		librarians and their ability to select materials based on their training and professional expertise.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is important now more than ever to stand against censorship and the removal of books or other
		materials from libraries. Librarians are professionals who have undergone specific training in the selection and
		acquisition of library materials. They follow collection development policies to aid in the selection of
		academic and leisure books. SCLA supports the principles of intellectual freedom and believes that all users,
		regardless of age, have a right to access library materials, services, and facilities. Parents of minors have
		the right to set restrictions for their own children, but no person or group should have the right to deny
		access to other children. </span></p>

<h1>Statements of Solidarity from RAAC and SCLA</h1>
Statement of Solidarity <br />Submitted by <br />Gerald B. Moore, Chair, Roundtable for African-American Concerns, SCLA
<p>June 8, 2020</p>
<p>The Roundtable for African-American Concerns (RAAC) of South Carolina Library Association (SCLA) stands in solidarity
	with the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA) in condemning violence and racism towards Black
	people and all people of color. Like BCALA with whom we stand, RAAC seeks to dismantle oppressive systems that
	continue to deny equal access, equal rights, and deter the advancement and uplifting of our African-American
	community. The recent killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Dominique Clayton are the latest
	in a long, treacherous history of violence against African-Americans in the United States.</p>
<p>As we reflect on this history while in the midst of peaceful protests and uprisings occurring across the nation, we
	are committed to using our platform to help library workers, library users, and the members of the communities we
	serve to eradicate racism and its offspring of injustice.</p>
<p>Racism is dehumanizing to everyone it touches. Beyond the actions of individuals, racism is embedded in the very
	fabric of our society.</p>
<p>We must use diversity, inclusion, and acceptance as the guiding principles in the fight to end acts of prejudice,
	racial bias, threats of violence, and even blatant killing based solely on a person’s race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>RAAC urges the Executive Board of SCLA and SCLA members to join them in condemning the systemic and systematic
	oppression of Black people and people of color. We stand with everyone who is actively fighting against repressive
	systems and we offer our support to those organizing proactive ways to combat racism.</p>
<p>___________________________________________</p>
<br />Statement from the SCLA Executive Committee
<p>June 11, 2020</p>
<p>The SCLA Executive Committee stands in full support of the statements put forth by the Roundtable for African
	American Concerns and the BCALA, and unequivocally joins them in “condemning the systemic and systematic oppression
	of Black people and people of color.”</p>
<p>Additionally, our profession and association have a responsibility to not only acknowledge the prejudices and racial
	biases in our own institutions, but to actively work to overthrow them. Racism and racist policies imbued the very
	start of libraries in America, and while it is convenient to think that the mere passage of time has eliminated it,
	the events of the past few weeks show that to not be true. If we are being honest with ourselves, it has persisted
	because we simply tried to ignore it. White supremacy and anti-Black state-sanctioned violence are alive and well
	all around the world.</p>
<p>We urge you to join us in condemning systemic and systematic injustice endured by Black people and people of color,
	and to actively work to promote a culture of anti-racism at home, at work, and in every aspect of our lives.
	Moreover, we urge you to tell us what you are going to do about it, and what we can do about it together. This is
	only where we begin.</p>
