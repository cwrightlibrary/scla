				<h1>Break Tradition by Visiting the Non-Stop Poster Session Zone</h1>
				<h2>Wednesday, October 18th @ Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center</h2>
				<p>We are breaking with tradition this year.  Rather than have one “poster session,” like the traditional early morning of the last day, we are having a “Non-Stop Poster Session Zone.”  During the conference there will be a three table “Non-Stop Poster Session Zone” near Registration for a series of poster sessions.  The Non-Stop Poster Session will give attendees a chance to discover something new between regular sessions, during a break, or as an option to attending a regular session.  Presenters will have the opportunity to be seen by more attendees and share their work and insights.</p>
