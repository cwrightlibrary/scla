## goals
- trim down bloated pages of text
- create consistency in fonts/colors
- modernize elements

## ideas
- no automatic downloading of pdfs

## notes on formatting
unless otherwise stated, the comments for an image correspond to the highlighted color in this order: 
- orange
- blue

# home page
## featured image
> ![featured image](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_featured_image.png?raw=true)
> 
> the contrast between the image and the text is a strain, either a shadow under the image or a darker image in general would fix this

## sidebar
> #### announcements/digital collection design
> ![announcements and digital collection design](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_sidebar/_announcements_digital_collection_design.png?raw=true)
> 
> the announcements section isn't really announcing anything and seems like it could be combined with upcoming events or possibly hidden until announcements are made
> 
> i like the historical image under digital collection but it doesn't fit into the site at all and probably doesn't belong on the home page
> 
> it would be nice to see the sidebar in a gray box so that it's clearly separated from the main content

## content
### 2023 scla conference - registration/conference program/etc. buttons
> #### text inconsistency
> ![scla conference text consistency](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_scla_conference_text_consistency.png?raw=true)
> 
> the first paragraph of text seems to be some kind of quote but it comes across as an inconsistency with the other paragraphs throughout the site. any combination of centering, italicizing, or adjusting font color would fix this. it might even work better to make the quote element smaller than the other text

> #### buttons
> ![sticky buttons](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_sticky_buttons_text.png?raw=true)
> 
> the buttons look okay but it feels weird to have these buttons in what seems to be an article
> 
> i would also consider moving the text underneath the buttons somewhere else to separate it from the buttons because it feels like the text is a caption or something for the buttons

### special guest speakers/special events
> #### special guest speakers
> ![special guest speakers](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_special_guest_speakers.png?raw=true)
> 
> these two sections of walls of text really need to be condensed somehow. the special guest speakers could be an automatic-slideshow of an image with the text.

> #### special events
> ![special events](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_special_events.png?raw=true)
> 
> this is just a wildly long section. it might work to visually turn it into a calendar or grid somehow. we could possibly turn each title into a button that toogles a collapse of the information underneath it

###  act now stay informed
> ![act now stay informed](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_act_now_stay_informed.png?raw=true)
> 
> i know this is an image but the styling is completely different than everything else on the site. i think it would work best to recreate this in our own style guidelines
> 
> similar to above, the font color and font sizing on the large link with the weird arrows throws off the rest of the design.

### statements
> ![statements members](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_statements_members_scholarships.png?raw=true)
> 
> this is obviously way too long. maybe we could do a toggle-to-collapse scenario like i mentioned previously but it seems like this belongs on its own dedicated page. it's also strange that in the middle of the statements lies the list of the **2021 lifetime members**, really seems out of place. similarly the **support for you and your library** and scholarship information seems like it doesn't belong.

# about scla
## about scla home
> ![about scla](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_about/_about_scla.PNG?raw=true)
> 
> this works well but it's really bland. i think it would look great if we could get an image of melanie here

## history of the association
> ![history of the association scla president meeting list](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_about/_history_of_the_association_scla_president_meeting_list.png?raw=true)
> 
> the first bit works well but i'd maybe just put the link in-line with the rest of the paragraph that says something like *read more about the scla's history here*
> 
> this second part definitely needs fixing, maybe put each line into a table somehow or each list could just be collapsible

## executive officers
> ![executive officers](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_about/_executive_officers.png?raw=true)
>
> i imagine it would work best to get these images onto a grid so the page isn't so long

# get involved
## advocacy
> ![advocacy](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_get_involved/_advocacy.PNG?raw=true)
>
> this works well but (like all other pages with embedded documents) the google doc shows up with the outline showing, making the document itself unreadable. if there's a way in the google document settings to automatically hide that, it would probably work better

## awards
> ![awards](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_get_involved/_awards.png?raw=true)
>
> hate to say it again but it's just too long and would work better as a collapsible list.

# job listings
i won't include a screenshot of this because it's crazy long, but if we could create links for each job and just have a list of the links here we could free up some space
