# scla notes
## goals
- trim down bloated pages of text
- create consistency in fonts/colors
- modernize elements

## ideas
- no automatic downloading of pdfs

# home page
## navigation bar

## featured image
the contrast between the image and the text is a strain, either a shadow under the image or a darker image in general would fix this

## sidebar
> **figure 1**
> 
> ![fig_home_sidebar_announcements_digital_collection](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_sidebar/_announcements_digital_collection.png?raw=true)
> 
> the announcements section isn't really announcing anything and seems like it could be combined with upcoming events or possibly hidden until announcements are made
> 
> i like the historical image under digital collection but it doesn't fit into the site at all and probably doesn't belong on the home page
> 
> it would be nice to see the sidebar in a gray box so that it's clearly separated from the main content

## content
### 2023 scla conference - registration/conference program/etc. buttons
> **figure 2**

> 
> the first paragraph of text seems to be some kind of quote but it comes across as an inconsistency with the other paragraphs throughout the site. any combination of centering, italicizing, or adjusting font color would fix this. it might even work better to make the quote element smaller than the other text
