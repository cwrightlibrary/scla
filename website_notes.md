# scla notes
## goals
- trim down bloated pages of text
- create consistency in fonts/colors
- modernize elements

## ideas
- no automatic downloading of pdfs

# home page
## navigation bar

## featured image
the contrast between the image and the text is a strain, either a shadow under the image or a darker image in general would fix this

## sidebar
> #### announcements/digital collection design
> ![announcements and digital collection design](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_sidebar/_announcements_digital_collection_design.png?raw=true)
> 
> the announcements section isn't really announcing anything and seems like it could be combined with upcoming events or possibly hidden until announcements are made
> 
> i like the historical image under digital collection but it doesn't fit into the site at all and probably doesn't belong on the home page
> 
> it would be nice to see the sidebar in a gray box so that it's clearly separated from the main content

## content
### 2023 scla conference - registration/conference program/etc. buttons
> #### text inconsistency
> ![scla conference text consistency](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_scla_conference_text_consistency.png?raw=true)
> the first paragraph of text seems to be some kind of quote but it comes across as an inconsistency with the other paragraphs throughout the site. any combination of centering, italicizing, or adjusting font color would fix this. it might even work better to make the quote element smaller than the other text

> #### buttons
> ![sticky buttons](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_sticky_buttons.png?raw=true)
> the buttons look okay but it feels weird to have these buttons in what seems to be an article
> i would also consider moving the text underneath the buttons somewhere else to separate it from the buttons because it feels like the text is a caption or something for the buttons

### special guest speakers/special events
> #### special guest speakers
> ![special guest speakers](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_special_guest_speakers.png?raw=true)
> these two sections of walls of text really need to be condensed somehow. the special guest speakers could be an automatic-slideshow of an image with the text.

> #### special events
> ![special events](https://github.com/cwrightlibrary/scla/blob/main/assets/website_notes/fig_/_home/_content/_special_events.png?raw=true)
> the special events section
